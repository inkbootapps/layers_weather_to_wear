# Layers: Weather to Wear — Support

Welcome to **Layers: Weather to Wear** 👋  
If you’re here, you’re probably looking for help, clarity, or a quick answer. This page covers the most common questions and how to get support.

---

## What is Layers?

**Layers** helps you decide what to wear based on the weather — not just temperature, but how it *actually feels*.

Instead of charts and numbers, Layers focuses on:
- practical outfit recommendations
- clothing layers that make sense for the day
- quick, glanceable weather context

Think of it as *“what should I wear today?”*, answered clearly.

---

## How recommendations work

Layers looks at:
- temperature (current, high, low)
- wind
- precipitation chance
- sun / UV
- time of day

From this, it suggests clothing **layers** (e.g. base, mid, outer, accessories) rather than specific brands or outfits.

Recommendations are meant to be:
- **practical**, not fashionable
- **conservative**, not risky
- easy to adapt to personal preference

You can adjust how warm or cool you run in **Settings**.

---

## Locations & device location

Layers supports:
- saved locations
- manual location search
- optional device (current) location

If you use device location:
- your location updates automatically
- it’s treated as a special “current location” mode
- you can switch back to a saved city at any time

Layers does **not** track or store your location history.

---

## Weather data & accuracy

Weather data is sourced from reliable third-party providers and refreshed periodically.

A small “Updated X min ago” label may appear **only when data is stale**, to give context if conditions seem off.

If something looks wrong:
- pull down to refresh
- double-check the selected location
- remember that local micro-climates can differ from forecasts

---

## Widgets

Layers offers home screen widgets for quick outfit guidance.

Widgets are designed to be:
- glanceable
- minimal
- battery-friendly

Because of system limits, widgets may update less frequently than the main app.

---

## Known limitations

- Layers does not account for how much time you will spend indoors vs. outdoors
- It does not know your exact clothing wardrobe
- It does not replace common sense (bring a jacket if you’re unsure!)

Use recommendations as guidance, not rules.

---

## Privacy

Layers respects your privacy.

- No account required
- No personal data sold
- Location access is optional
- No tracking for advertising

For full details, see the **Privacy Policy**.

## Getting help

If you have:
- a bug to report
- a question about recommendations
- feedback or feature ideas

Please contact:

**Email:** inkbootllc@gmail.com

When reporting a bug, it helps to include:
- your device and OS version
- the location you were viewing
- what you expected vs what you saw

---

## Feedback

Layers is intentionally simple, but it’s still evolving.

If something feels confusing, cluttered, or unnecessary — that’s valuable feedback.  
If something helps you decide what to wear faster — that’s the goal.

Thanks for using **Layers: Weather to Wear** 🌤️👕
